I'm not convinced we are the smartest beings, especially when it comes to consuming. As grassland grazers lacking their predators, we're headed for tough times. Perhaps there is a belief that someone else will make the right decisions for us? But we all know that's not true, not any more. If you are unaware you may be behind the times. There are ways and means of solving this hot water we find ourselves stewing in. Luckily there are some smart people amongst us, and they're doing all the tough work for us. A lot of the time we're just doing it wrong -- and in this case, it's easy to make a good choice.

No longer is ignorance bliss, just as we know that eating fast food is bad for us, we know that making environmentally-harmful decisions is fast becoming a non-option. But _what_ is an environmentally-harmful decision?

Luckily here at TAL our aim is to show you how to make better choices, ones that are easy to make. Who knows, maybe you will be able to recite the scientific name of a yellowfin tuna one day. Or look up why we should eat Dorado instead of Red Steenbras. The idea with this series, (I call it _**Fish on the Line**_) is to showcase the species one would normally encounter on the shelves or while fishing or spearfishing, but in a different way. I hope it makes you think twice, thats all it takes.

So, instead of 'liking' these posts, why not 'share' instead? Rather than read and discard; forward or re-tweet. Follow us, or like our facebook page -- it'll be worth it. We're all journalists, we're all enforcers, we're all educators. Social media and smart phones have equipped each and every one of us. Spread the word! JB
